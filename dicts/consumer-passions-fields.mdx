description: "CPI Indices are a measure of the strength of one's interest in a given CPI affinity. The indices range from 9 to 0, with 9 representing someone with the strongest interest in that affinity, and 1 represents someone with the weakest interest in that affinity. 0 indicates that there is no none interest in that affinity. All passions are based on a combination of purchases from direct marketing and retail channels, and/or from interests as determined by surveys or websites. "

The indices are derived using our data provider's propriety methodology. To start, each contributing source file is given a value based on its ability to identify the strength of its affinities. For example, survey files receive the lowest values, and magazines/catalogs receive the highest values – actually purchasing a product in a given affinity shows a greater degree of interest than just checking off a survey box. In addition, for survey files, double-counting is limited: If one checks off one box for fly fishing and another for saltwater fishing, that person only gets credit for fishing once. On the other hand, if one subscribes to a fly fishing and a saltwater magazine, that person gets credited twice for fishing.
