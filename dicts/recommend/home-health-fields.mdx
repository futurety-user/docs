The originating known age data is compiled from a variety of sources that may include public data, buying activities data, and self-reported information. A value is only assigned for this field if a record for the AGE_RANGE_ESTIMATED field is not available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Use this field if you are looking close to complete age range coverage within the TCI universe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
